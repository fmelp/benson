It was great chatting with you at the recent BeverageLovers meetup.  We’d love to take some next steps to see if working together is something that would make sense for both parties.

As we mentioned, we are affiliated with Diageo International, a leading beverage producer, and we have a new drink we are bringing to market in Q3 2015.  The target audience for this new drink, "Brain Juice," are young striving professionals who are working hard, burning the candle at both ends, and need an edge to make sure both their brains and bodies are fully powered when it counts most.  Gender is not important, but we believe that our target customers should best trial this product in a very specific time window - either in early the morning (to fuel up on the way to work), or in the late afternoon / early evening (to fuel up for the gym, happy hour, or the club).

We believe the best way to find these customers for a sample trial will be the use of street teams, who will set up table with Brain Juice product samples, offer testers coupons for additional Brain Juice purchases, and collect customer contact information for our monthly "Be the Brain of tomorrow" newsletter, full of tips for tomorrow's aspiring professional.
 
We would like to engage you to harness the power of data and analytics to optimize the deployment of our street teams near subway stations - it's a big city, so where should we locate our teams to engage the largest number of customers?   If possible, we also want to ensure that customer have a good experience with Brain Juice, so we'd like to avoid long lines if possible.    I've heard that the MTA makes subway ridership data available, so maybe you can look into this as a tool for this work?

The ball is in your court now—do you think this is something that would be feasible for your group? From there we can explore what kind of an engagement would make sense for all of us.

Best,

Dr. Jennifer J Pepper
Diageo International
